# blockchain-geocaching-solidity

A Solidity smart contract for geocaching.

You can hide geocaching boxes with priviate keys inside and register them on the blockchain with their public key.
If you find a geocaching box, you can sign your blockchain adress with the private key inside, and if it checks out, you will be registered as the owner on the blockchain.

This was homework project for a class, while it's well-tested, we do not take resposibility for any issues if you decide to actually deploy this on the blockchain.
