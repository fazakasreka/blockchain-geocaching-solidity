# blockchain-geocaching-solidity

This Solidity smart contract enables geocaching with blockchain verification.

- Users can hide geocaching boxes containing private keys and register them on the blockchain using the corresponding public key.
- When someone finds a geocaching box, they can sign their blockchain address with the private key inside.
- If the signature is valid, the contract updates the finder as the new registered owner.

**Disclaimer**: This was a homework project for a class. While it is well-tested, we do not take responsibility for any issues if you decide to deploy it on the blockchain.
